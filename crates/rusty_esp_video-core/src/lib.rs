#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! `rusty_esp_video-core` — the pure heart of `rusty_esp_video`.
//!
//! Rules this crate lives by (from the Janus mission plan):
//!
//! 1. `no_std` by default; `alloc` is a feature, never an assumption.
//! 2. No drivers, no HAL types, no `esp-*` crate, no allocator. Backends live
//!    in `rusty_esp_video-esp`.
//! 3. Every type that crosses to another Janus package comes from
//!    `rusty_esp_core`, so packages compose without conversions.
//! 4. Frames and buffers are **borrowed over caller-owned memory**; nothing
//!    here allocates per frame on a hot path.
//! 5. `forbid(unsafe)`. The scalar path is the oracle; any faster path is gated
//!    byte-identical against it.
