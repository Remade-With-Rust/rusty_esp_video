The chip backends for the video package: the stream server over standard sockets — which is what ESP-IDF's `std` gives the chip, so it runs on the host unchanged — plus the pieces that are ESP-IDF only.

| track | what it is |
|---|---|
| **A** | `std` on ESP-IDF — an operating system, Wi-Fi, sockets, threads |
| **B** | `no_std` on `esp-hal` — bare metal, no heap unless you ask for one |

## Where the evidence is

This crate is part of [`rusty_esp_video`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_video). The
hardware results, the method lines and the open defects live in that package's
[README](https://github.com/Remade-With-Rust/rusty_esp_video#readme) and in
[`docs/LEDGER.md`](https://github.com/Remade-With-Rust/rusty_esp_video/blob/main/docs/LEDGER.md), where no number
appears without the run that produced it.

## Part of Janus

**Janus** rebuilds the Espressif ESP32 and Arduino application portfolio as
independent, memory-safe Rust packages — so a hardware maker can ship a device
that the [MATA](https://www.mata.network) home computer discovers, catalogs honestly, adopts
under its own identity, and pays for. Ten packages, three layers, and the
dependency direction never reverses.

| layer | packages |
|---|---|
| **0 — the vocabulary** | [`rusty_esp_core`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_core) · [`rusty_esp_dsp`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_dsp) |
| **1 — the functions** | [`rusty_esp_image`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_image) · [`rusty_esp_video`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_video) · [`rusty_esp_audio`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_audio) · [`rusty_esp_signal`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_signal) · [`rusty_esp_mid`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_mid) · [`rusty_esp_iroh`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_iroh) |
| **2 — the surfaces** | [`rusty_esp_arduino`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_esp_arduino) — the sketch facade · [`espino`](https://crates.io/crates/espino) — the maker's CLI |

Every package is host-verified against an external oracle and keeps a ledger
in which no number appears without the run that produced it. **Five of seven
device profiles have now run their kill tests on real silicon**, three of them
over a Wi-Fi network the board hosts itself.

[`rusty_alloc`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_alloc), the pure-Rust rebuild of
mimalloc that these firmwares run on, and
[`rusty_jpeg`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_jpeg), the JPEG engine behind the
camera path — and our sister project
[remade_ffmpeg_rs](https://github.com/Remade-With-Rust/remade_ffmpeg_rs), a ground-up Rust rebuild of FFmpeg.
